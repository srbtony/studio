### ðŸ§© GAME MECHANICS CONTEXT

Make sure all suggestions respect these rules:

#### ðŸŽ® Desperate Buy (DB) System
- Players can spend gold to retry a level when they're about to lose
- Potential use-case would be to continue their streak and increases level progress , as well as clearing a level that player is having difficulty winning

#### ðŸ’° In-Game Store
- Players can buy:
  - gold = real money purchase
  - powerup = costs gold

#### ðŸ”‹ Powerup Mechanics
- Each powerup reduces effective difficulty by certain extent

#### Level difficulty types
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

- Level winRate is impacted by level base difficulty , skill level of player , power-up usage in-level and desperate buys used in-level

#### ðŸ“ˆ Wallet Evolution Rules
- All players start with the same base wallet:
  - Initial Gold: 0
  - Initial Powerups: 0
- Wallet values evolve based on:
  - Level wins (+gold)
  - Powerup use (-gold)
  - Desperate Buy (-gold)
  - Real-money purchases (+gold)
  - Powerup purchases (-gold, +powerups)
